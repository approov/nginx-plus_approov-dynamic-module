This Approov integration example will show you how simple its to integrate the [Approov Token](https://www.approov.io/docs/v2.0/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) check to protect the access to your API backend. This integration doesn't require any changes to your backend code, and only requires minimal changes to the Nginx Plus configuration.
